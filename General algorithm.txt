General algorithm:

In this note we present the general algorithm for solving the system of coupled
 differential equations that describe the behavior of the molar concentration of 
a molecule in aqueous solution under gamma radiation and an example with the system
 of formic acid.
Numerical methods are required to obtain a solution to equations 1 and 2.
We present the general structure of the algorithm is presented in the following:
1.	We use the numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries.
2.	A function f(t,y) is defined. Within this function we have defined the external 
source term (equation 2) variables, the rate constants and the chemical reaction path 
of each chemical species.
3.	The list (return[]) is used to call all the variables that represent the each 
chemical species and their molar concentration changes (equation 1).
4.	An array (or vector) is defined with the initial molar concentration of each variable
 within the list return[]. For practical purposes it is defined as y0 = np.array([]).
5.	Another array is defined with the integration interval {h_span = np.array([0, n])}; 
and the linear space of the system, which that represents the time advance in the system:  
h = np.linspace(h_span[0], h_span[1],n).
6.	A solver for computing the ODEs system is defined from the solve_ivp library. This 
solver requires the following inputs: the function, the integration interval, 
the initial conditions, integration method, and the number of steps in the solution.
solve = solve_ivp(f, h_span, y0, method='BDF', h_eval=times)
7.	Next to, the computed solution for each chemical species can be called. 
From a chemical point of view, this means that it is possible to obtain numerical
 information about the molar concentration of each chemical species in the system.
